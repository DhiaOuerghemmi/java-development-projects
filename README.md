# Java Projects Hub

A curated **global** mono-repo for all of your Java-based applications, libraries, and microservices. Each subdirectory contains a standalone project with its own build scripts, tests, documentation, and CI/CD workflows. As new projects are added, this README will be updated accordingly.

---

## Introduction

This repository acts as a centralized home for all Java initiativesâ€”ranging from small utility libraries to full-blown Spring Boot microservices. It enforces consistency in:
- **Build & Dependency Management** (Maven or Gradle)  
- **Testing** (JUnit 5, integration tests with Testcontainers)  
- **Quality Gates** (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, coverage reports)  
- **CI/CD** (GitHub Actions workflows per project)  
- **Documentation** (Per-project README, shared conventions)
